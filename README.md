# Open Organization Maturity Model

## About

The Open Organization Maturity Model is a resource for organizations seeking to better embrace open principles and practices.

It is derived from [the Open Organization Definition](https://github.com/open-organization/open-org-definition) and maintained by [the Open Organization community](http://theopenorganization.org).

## Additional resources

[The Open Organization Capability Model](https://www.ready-to-innovate.com/openorg/) forks and operationalizes this maturity model in an interactive, open source tool that is [also seeking feedback, modification, and enhancement](https://github.com/redhat-cop/open-organization).
